##Backend

First, to run the backend project or the api we need to understand that in this project we have a local configuration, even in the .env file, so we need to install all the dependencies

but in this case, as we already have the dependencies just run in terminal inside the api folder

`npm run dev` and the project will run in the 3001 port

##Frontend
now when we tried to run our frontend app we also need to install all the dependencies,

in my case, i used React as framework, with vite and tailwindcss, these tools are the best way to do a simple
app, it's very easy to build apps with these packages, and frameworks, 

then we need to run (because we already have all the dependencies and the proxies to run backend by cors)
`npm run dev` and the project will run at the same time in the port 5173(vite default)


if that gets error, just run `npm run dev` or install tailwindcss manually `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
and then run `npm run dev


## final

now that we run both projects, it's easy to search in my browser localhost:5173,

and the gui is very friendly so you'll understand what i did.

Greetings, i hope you enjoy this short project
